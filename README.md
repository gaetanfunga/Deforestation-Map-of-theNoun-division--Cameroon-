This map is a representation of land use change in the Noun region of Cameroon from 2013 to 2023. 
The map was produced using 2013 and 2023 Landsat images collected from USGS websites. 
I used ArcGIS 10.5 and the modeling processes comprised: 
Raster merging - NDVI calculation - Reclassification (vegetation and no vegetation) Raster to polygon conversion - Disolve - intersection
